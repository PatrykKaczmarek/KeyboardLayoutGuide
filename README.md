**This repository is part of [Introduction To Missing Keyboard Layout Guide](https://www.netguru.com/codestories/introduction-to-missing-keyboard-layout-guide) code story. Read it for more information.**


### Content

The repository contains a surprisingly simple solution used by me for the keyboard handling issue. It consists of [source files](https://github.com/PatrykKaczmarek/KeyboardLayoutGuide/tree/master/KeyboardLayoutGuide/KeyboardLayoutGuide) and 4 demo cases for:

- A sign-in screen: has a simple view hierarchy
- A ruler screen: contains `UIScrollView` with long content size
- A catalog screen: contains `UITableView` with content filtering
- A 🎉 screen: reacts on the keyboard occurrence

Happy coding 👩‍💻🧑‍💻!
